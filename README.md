The TSIS-CORSIM (Traffic Software Integrated System â€“ Corridor Simulation) is an integrated development environment that enables users to conduct traffic operations analysis. It is developed by McTrans from University of Florida. TSIS-CORSIM is a microscopic traffic simulation model that allow simulate urban and roadway networks, including Two-way highways.

I coded a program to extract the full information about vehicles from file TSD (below version 6.1) and TS0 (version 6.2 and upper), derived from Sudheer Dhulipala [2012] thesis, Faculty of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. <[Thesis](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/33426)> 

The program was coded in C++. The Python version is coming.
